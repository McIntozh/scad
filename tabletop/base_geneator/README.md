This is a generator for miniature bases and base toppers with patterns of European plaster stones/pavements.

**What are base the toppers good for?**
If you want to keep the current base of your figure but have the pattern on the surface, you can cut the figure from the base, glue the topper on that base and then glue the figure on top.

Example toppers and bases in "32 mm scale" which is 1/57.2 can be found on my thingiverse account: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6021484
